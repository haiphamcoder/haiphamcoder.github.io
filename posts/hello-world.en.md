# Hello World

Welcome to **Hai Pham Blog** - your go-to resource for practical Backend Engineering knowledge!

## Why does this blog exist?

After years of working with **Java/Spring Boot** in production, I realized that:

- **Real-world knowledge** from production environments is hard to find and rarely shared
- **Best practices** evolve constantly and need regular updates  
- **Debugging experience** and system optimization insights are incredibly valuable

## What you'll find here

### 🚀 **Performance & Optimization**

- Spring Boot optimization, JVM tuning
- Database optimization, connection pooling
- Caching strategies (Redis, Caffeine)

### 🏗️ **System Architecture**

- Microservices patterns
- Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Distributed systems challenges

### 🔧 **DevOps & Observability**

- Monitoring with Micrometer, OpenTelemetry
- Logging strategies
- Container & Kubernetes

### 💡 **Real-world Solutions**

- Production code examples
- Debug techniques
- Troubleshooting guides

## Philosophy

> **"From practice, for practice"** - Every post comes from real-world experience, not theoretical concepts.
