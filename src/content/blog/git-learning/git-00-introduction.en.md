Welcome to the **"Learning Git"** series — compiled based on the book "Learning Git A Hands-On and Visual Guide to the Basics of Git" by author **Anna Skoulikari**.

The goal of the series is to provide a high-quality technical document (technical deep dive) to help you understand the nature of Git, from core concepts to advanced techniques.

## Why Git?

Git is not just a tool; it is the industry standard for version control. Whether you are a developer, DevOps engineer, or technical writer, mastering Git is a mandatory skill.

In this series, we won't follow the "rote learning" of commands. Instead, we will build a **mental model** of how Git works underneath, helping you confidently handle any situation—even the most complex merge conflicts or rebase "disasters."

## Learning Path

This series consists of 12 main chapters and appendices, leading you from zero to proficiency:

### Part 1: Foundations

- **[Chapter 1: Git and the Command Line](/en/blog/git-01-command-line)**: Getting acquainted with the command line interface, installing Git, and basic operations.
- **[Chapter 2: Local Repositories](/en/blog/git-02-local-repositories)**: Initializing repositories, understanding the Working Directory and Staging Area.
- **[Chapter 3: Making a Commit](/en/blog/git-03-making-commit)**: The process of creating commits and storing versions.

### Part 2: Branching & Merging

- **[Chapter 4: Branches](/en/blog/git-04-branches)**: Creating, switching, and managing parallel development branches.
- **[Chapter 5: Merging](/en/blog/git-05-merging)**: Merging branches and understanding Fast-forward merges.

### Part 3: Remote & Collaboration

- **[Chapter 6: Hosting Services & Authentication](/en/blog/git-06-hosting-auth)**: Working with GitHub/GitLab and authentication mechanisms.
- **[Chapter 7: Remote Repositories](/en/blog/git-07-remote-repos)**: Pushing code to remote repositories.
- **[Chapter 8: Cloning & Fetching](/en/blog/git-08-cloning)**: Cloning repositories and synchronizing data.

### Part 4: Advanced Techniques

- **[Chapter 9: Three-Way Merges](/en/blog/git-09-three-way-merge)**: Complex merging when history is non-linear.
- **[Chapter 10: Merge Conflicts](/en/blog/git-10-merge-conflicts)**: Handling source code conflicts—the most important skill for a developer.
- **[Chapter 11: Rebasing](/en/blog/git-11-rebasing)**: Rewriting commit history for a clean and beautiful timeline.
- **[Chapter 12: Pull Requests](/en/blog/git-12-pull-requests)**: Code review process and collaboration in large teams.

## Required Tools

To follow this series most effectively, you need to prepare:

1. A computer running **Linux (Ubuntu)** (recommended), macOS, or Windows.
2. **Terminal**: Command-line tool (Terminal on Linux/macOS, Git Bash on Windows).
3. **Text Editor**: Recommended to use **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**.
4. **Git**: The latest version (we will install it in Chapter 1).

Let's start the journey to conquer Git now!
